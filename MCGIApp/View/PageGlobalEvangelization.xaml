                            After preaching nightly in the towns of Pampanga, Philippines for more than a decade during the 1970s, Bro. Eli Soriano realized that it would take him many more years just to reach a large part of the country. Back then, radio was a popular medium that can offer the means to carry the voice of Bro. Eli to a wider mileage at a cost cheaper than television.

This technology has proven to be an effective means in delivering information regardless of distance and difference in time, therefore Members Church of God International leaders, Bro.Eli and Bro.Daniel, decided to put it to good use.

Satellite broadcasting was the best option.
