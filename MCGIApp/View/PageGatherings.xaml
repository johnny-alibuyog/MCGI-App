Added to the previous service obtaining in 2011, MCGI started with the Book of Genesis to initiate bible-reading sessions.

The time came however when brethren requested that they hear a biblical topic as well. Since then, the Prayer Meeting became similar in format to the Worship Service, albeit, without the monetary contribution. This service is based on Hebrews 10:25-26.
